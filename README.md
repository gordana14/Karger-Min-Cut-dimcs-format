# Karger-Min-Cut-dimcs-format-

Implement this algorithm in the C# .Net (Windows forms). The program should accept undirected graphs in the DIMACS format.
I investigate how many runs of this algorithm are necessary to obtain the optimal solution.
For each instance of the given graph, aplication draw a chart that showing:
1. One typical execution of the algorithm, i.e. time (run number) on the x axis, and
the current obtained solution 
the currently best solution.
2. The distribution of the number of runs before the optimal cut is found
